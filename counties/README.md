# US Counties Infection Estimates

For an aggregated version of the county estimates (in a single csv file), see https://github.com/youyanggu/covid19-datasets (Note: that version will be not updated daily).

See our methodology: [Estimating True Infections Revisited](http://covid19-projections.com/estimating-true-infections-revisited).

*Note:* Our county-level positivity rates and prevalence ratios are taken directly from the state-wide estimates.
