# US Latest Infection Estimates

**March 8, 2021 Update:** We made our last daily update on March 7. This repository will no longer be maintained. Read Youyang Gu's [One Year Later](https://youyanggu.com/blog/one-year-later) blog post for a detailed explanation and for a list of alternate resources.

This is the repository containing the data for US national, state, and county level true infection estimates from [covid19-projections.com](https://covid19-projections.com/). For a detailed methodology, see [here](https://covid19-projections.com/estimating-true-infections-revisited/).

For historical national and state level estimates, visit our [full repository](https://github.com/youyanggu/covid19_projections/tree/master/infection_estimates).

These estimates are updated daily.

We want to highlight that while these estimates are based on the best available data, they may not be representative for individual counties, where testing and reporting standards can vary widely.

Please visit the [full repository](https://github.com/youyanggu/covid19_projections/tree/master/infection_estimates) for column descriptions.
