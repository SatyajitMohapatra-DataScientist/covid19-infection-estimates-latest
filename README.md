# US Latest Infection Estimates

This is the repository containing the data for US national, state, and county level true infection estimates from [covid19-projections.com](https://covid19-projections.com/). For a detailed methodology, see [here](https://covid19-projections.com/estimating-true-infections-revisited/).

These estimates are updated daily.

We want to highlight that while these estimates are based on the best available data, they may not be representative for individual counties, where testing and reporting standards can vary widely.
