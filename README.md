# US County-level Infection Estimates

US county-level true infection estimates from [covid19-projections.com](https://covid19-projections.com/).

For state-level estimates, visit our [main repository](https://github.com/youyanggu/covid19_projections/tree/master/infection_estimates). Due to the large file sizes of county-level infection estimates (~250MB), we have moved the county-level data to its own repository here.

These estimates are updated daily.

[`1_latest_percent_infected_counties.csv`](1_latest_percent_infected_counties.csv) contains the latest currently infected and total infected estimates for all counties. We want to highlight that while these are estimates based on the best available data, they may not be representative for individual counties, where testing and reporting standards can vary widely.

Please visit the [main repository](https://github.com/youyanggu/covid19_projections/tree/master/infection_estimates) for column descriptions.
