# US Latest Infection Estimates

*December 17, 2020 Update:* We changed our repository name from `covid19-infection-estimates-counties` to `covid19-infection-estimates-latest` include the latest national and state level estimates. We also moved the county level estimates to its own directory. We hope this will serve as a better centralized source for those who want to download simply the latest data. We apologize for any inconvenience.

This is the repository containing the data for US national, state, and county level true infection estimates from [covid19-projections.com](https://covid19-projections.com/). For a detailed methodology, see [here](https://covid19-projections.com/estimating-true-infections-revisited/).

For historical national and state level estimates, visit our [full repository](https://github.com/youyanggu/covid19_projections/tree/master/infection_estimates).

These estimates are updated daily.

We want to highlight that while these estimates are based on the best available data, they may not be representative for individual counties, where testing and reporting standards can vary widely.
