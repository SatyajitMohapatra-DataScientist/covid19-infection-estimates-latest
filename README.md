# US County-level Infection Estimates

US county-level true infection estimates from [covid19-projections.com](https://covid19-projections.com/).

Due to the large file sizes of county-level infection estimates (~250MB), we have moved the data to its own repository here. For state-level estimates, visit [here](https://github.com/youyanggu/covid19_projections/tree/master/infection_estimates).

Please visit the repository above for column descriptions. These estimates are updated daily.
